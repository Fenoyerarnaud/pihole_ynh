If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview

Network-wide ad blocking via your own DNS server.

**Shipped version:** 5.3.1~ynh1

## Disclaimers / important information

## Configuration

Use the admin panel of your Pi-hole to configure this app. You may also need to follow the [post-install guide](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/post-install/) to setup Pi-hole either as a *DNS server* or a *DHCP server*.

## Limitations

* Activate DHCP with Pi-hole needs manual configuration of your router.
* Pi-Hole can't be updated beyond version 3.3.1, because higher versions use an integrated version of dnsmasq. This would require disabling the version of dnsmasq used by YunoHost.
